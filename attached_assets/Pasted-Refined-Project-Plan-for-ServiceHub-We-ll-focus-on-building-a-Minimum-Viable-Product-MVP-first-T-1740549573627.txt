Refined Project Plan for ServiceHub
We’ll focus on building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first. This will include the most essential features to make the platform functional. Once the MVP is complete, you can add advanced features like real-time tracking, analytics, and promotions.

Step 1: Define the MVP
Here’s what your MVP should include:

1. User Roles & Authentication
User Roles: User (Client), Service Provider, Admin.

Authentication: JWT for login/signup.

Email Verification: Send a verification link to the user’s email.

Password Reset: Allow users to reset their password via email.

2. User Features
Profile Management: Users can update their name, email, phone, and location.

Search & Filters: Users can search for service providers by category (e.g., plumber, electrician) and location.

Booking: Users can book a service provider for a specific date and time.

Reviews & Ratings: Users can rate and review service providers after the service is completed.

3. Service Provider Features
Profile Setup: Service providers can add their services, pricing, and availability.

Service Request Management: Providers can accept or reject booking requests.

Earnings Dashboard: Providers can view their earnings (basic version).

4. Admin Features
User Management: Admin can ban users or service providers.

Service Listing Approval: Admin can approve or reject service listings.

Step 2: Tech Stack for MVP
Since you’re a beginner, we’ll use beginner-friendly technologies:

Frontend
React.js: For building the user interface.

Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS: For styling.

Axios: For making API calls to the backend.

Backend
Node.js with Express.js: For building the server and APIs.

MongoDB: For storing data (users, service providers, bookings, etc.).

Mongoose: For interacting with MongoDB.

Authentication
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For user authentication.

Bcrypt: For hashing passwords.

Payment Integration
Stripe: For handling payments (use test mode for now).

Hosting
Heroku: For deploying your application (free tier available).

Step 3: Break Down the Project into Smaller Tasks
Here’s a step-by-step guide to building the MVP:

1. Set Up the Project
Create a new folder for your project (ServiceHub).

Initialize a Node.js project: npm init -y.

Install dependencies: npm install express mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken cors dotenv axios.

2. Build the Backend
Create a basic Express server.

Set up MongoDB and connect it to your app.

Create models for:

User: name, email, password, role (user, provider, admin).

Service: title, description, price, category, providerId.

Booking: userId, providerId, date, time, status (pending, accepted, rejected).

Create APIs for:

User registration and login.

Profile management.

Service listing and search.

Booking management.

Reviews and ratings.

3. Build the Frontend
Set up a React app: npx create-react-app client.

Create pages for:

Homepage (search for services).

User/Provider dashboard.

Service details and booking.

Profile management.

Use Axios to connect the frontend to your backend APIs.

4. Implement Authentication
Add JWT-based authentication.

Protect routes (e.g., only logged-in users can book services).

Implement email verification and password reset.

5. Add Payment Integration
Integrate Stripe for handling payments (start with test mode).

6. Deploy the App
Deploy the backend to Heroku.

Deploy the frontend to Netlify or Vercel.

Step 4: Learn and Build Gradually
Since you’re a beginner, focus on learning as you build:

Learn the Basics: Understand how Node.js, Express, and MongoDB work.

Build One Feature at a Time: Start with user registration, then move to service listing, booking, etc.

Test Your Code: Use tools like Postman to test your APIs.

Refactor and Improve: Once the MVP is complete, refactor your code and add advanced features.

Step 5: Advanced Features (Post-MVP)
Once the MVP is complete, you can add:

Real-Time Tracking: Use Google Maps API.

In-App Chat: Use WebSockets or a library like Socket.io.

Analytics Dashboard: Use a library like Chart.js.

Promotions and Discounts: Add a coupon system
